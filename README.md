**Author:** DaKoda Gillian  
**Purpose:** This repository serves as my digital notebook for tracking backend development projects, lessons learned, and useful resources throughout the course.

## Overview
This repository serves as my digital notebook for backend development. It includes projects, notes, and resources from each course unit.

## Learning Objectives
- Strengthen backend scripting and server management skills.
- Develop RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.
- Apply Git and version control best practices in real-world workflows.

## How I’ll Use This Repository
Throughout the semester, I’ll document each unit’s projects and lessons learned. I’ll also maintain a learning log, add references, and use this repo as a resource hub for backend development.
